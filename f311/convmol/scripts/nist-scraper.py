"""
Retrieves and prints a table of molecular constants from the NIST Chemistry Web Book [NISTRef]

To do so, it uses web scraping to navigate through several pages and parse the desired information
from the book web pages.

It does not provide a way to list the molecules yet, but will give an error if the molecule is not
found in the NIST web book.

Example:

    print-nist.py OH

**Note** This script was designed to work with **diatomic molecules** and may not work with other
         molecules.

**Warning** The source material online was known to contain mistakes (such as an underscore instead
            of a minus signal to indicate a negative number). We have identified a few of these,
            and build some workarounds. However, we recommend a close look at the information parsed
            before use.

**Disclaimer** This script may stop working if the NIST people update the Chemistry Web Book.
