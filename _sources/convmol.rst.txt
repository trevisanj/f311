Conversion sources:

- Robert Kurucz molecular line lists (fully implemented (old and new Kurucz format))
- HITRAN Online database (partially implemented)
- VALD3 (to do)
- TurboSpectrum (to do)

Conversion destination:

- PFANT molecular lines format

Applications
------------

Graphical applications:

- ``convmol.py`` -- Conversion of molecular lines data to PFANT format

Command-line tools:

- ``hitran-scraper.py`` -- Retrieves molecular lines from the HITRAN database


- ``nist-scraper.py`` -- Retrieves molecular constants from NIST Web Book for a particular molecule
