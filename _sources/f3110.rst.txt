Package f311
============

The ``f311`` "root" package provides the **collaboration model implementation**. This is a plugin
model that allows 3rd-party **collaborator packages** to contribute with

- ``DataFile`` subclasses, *i.e.*, implement handling (load, save, etc.) of new file types;
- ``Vis`` subclasses, *i.e.*, implement visualizations for these files;
- Standalone scripts that will be listed by ``programs.py``

3rd-party collaborator packages
-------------------------------

At present (2017-11-30), two 3rd-party collaborator packages are "registered" to work together with
project F311 code:

- `Package ariastro <http://github.com/aricorte/ariastro>`_
- Package "convmolworks" (in-house)
