Introduction
------------

<<<<<<< HEAD

        mained.py ........ Main configuration file editor.
        mled.py .......... Molecular lines file editor.
        splisted.py ...... Spectrum List Editor
        tune-zinf.py ..... Tunes the "zinf" parameter for each atomic line in atomic
                           lines file

      Command-line tools
      ------------------

        create-grid.py ... Merges several atmospheric models into a single file
                           (_i.e._, the "grid")
        cut-atoms.py ..... Cuts atomic lines file to wavelength interval specified
        cut-molecules.py . Cuts molecular lines file to wavelength interval
                           specified
        cut-spectrum.py .. Cuts spectrum file to wavelength interval specified
        plot-spectra.py .. Plots spectra on screen or creates PDF file
        vald3-to-atoms.py  Converts VALD3 atomic/molecular lines file to PFANT
                           atomic lines file.

    Package 'pyfant'
    ================

      Graphical applications
      ----------------------

        x.py ........ PFANT Launcher -- Graphical Interface for Spectral Synthesis

      Command-line tools
      ------------------

        copy-star.py  Copies stellar data files (such as main.dat, abonds.dat,
                      dissoc.dat) to local directory
        link.py ..... Creates symbolic links to PFANT data files as an alternative
                      to copying these (sometimes large) files into local directory
        run4.py ..... Runs the four Fortran binaries in sequence: `innewmarcs`,
                      `hydro2`, `pfant`, `nulbad`
        save-pdf.py . Looks for files "*.norm" inside directories session-* and
                      saves one figure per page in a PDF file

    PFANT Fortran binaries
    ======================

        innewmarcs  found
        hydro2 .... found
        pfant ..... found
        nulbad .... found



Sub-packages
------------

When f311 is installed, several sub-packages are made available (see left menu).
Each sub-package contains its own API.

One possible way to import these sub-packages is as follows:

.. code::

    import f311.pyfant as pf
    import f311.convmol as cm
    import f311.explorer as ex
    import f311.filetypes as ft
    import f311.physics as ph
    import f311.aosss as ao

For usage and examples, see the sub-packages pages.

=======
F311 is a collection of Python 3 libraries, command-line and graphical applications for Astronomy.

The code is organized in sub-packages, each one containing scripts (applications) and an API related
to some topic.

To get a listing of all scripts available at once, simply type on your shell:

.. code:: shell

   programs.py

This will print a listing such as :doc:`this one <programs-py-listing>`.

``explorer.py`` (:doc:`screenshot <explorer-py-screenshot>`) is perhaps the application of broadest interest.
It is a file browser that allows you to visualize and edit many file formats used in Astronomy. Its file-handling abilities can be
easily expanded.

To use the APIs to write your own code, the f311 subpackages that can be imported like this:

.. code::

    import f311.pyfant as pf
    import f311.convmol as cm
    import f311.explorer as ex
    import f311.filetypes as ft
    import f311.physics as ph
    import f311.aosss as ao

Although the code is not throughout on the topics covered, some parts of the code were structured
to be comprehensively and easily expanded.

The project started in 2015 at IAG-USP (Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences
at University of São Paulo, Brazil).
