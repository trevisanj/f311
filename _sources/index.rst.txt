Introduction
------------

f311 is another - but *not* just another - Python open-source project for Astronomy. It contains many
graphical and command-line standalone applications, and we think that some of them are cool!

The code is organized in sub-packages, each one containing scripts (applications) and API related
to some topic.
To get a listing of all scripts available at once, simply type on your shell:

.. code:: shell

   programs.py

This will print a listing such as :doc:`this one <programs-py-listing>`.

``explorer.py`` (:doc:`screenshot <explorer-py-screenshot>`) is perhaps the application of broadest interest.
It is a file browser that allows you to visualize and edit many file formats used in Astronomy. Its file-handling abilities can be
easily expanded.

To use the APIs to write your own code, the f311 subpackages that can be imported like this:

.. code::

    import f311.pyfant as pf
    import f311.convmol as cm
    import f311.explorer as ex
    import f311.filetypes as ft
    import f311.physics as ph
    import f311.aosss as ao

Although the code is not throughout on the topics covered, some parts of the code were structured
to be comprehensively and easily expanded.

The project started in 2015 at IAG-USP (Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences
at University of São Paulo, Brazil).
