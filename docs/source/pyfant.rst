*f311.pyfant*: spectral synthesis
=================================

Welcome!!

pyfant is a Python interface for the `PFANT Spectral Synthesis
Software <http://github.com/trevisanj/PFANT>`__ for Astronomy.

- run several spectral synthesis "jobs" in parallel using ``x.py``

- write your own spectral synthesis scripts using the ``f311.pyfant`` package

Spectral Synthesis Softwares (SSS) have several applications in
Astronomy. Spectral synthesis is a crucial step in optimization
algorithms, in which the synthetic spectrum is compared with the measure
spectrum of a star, in order to determine stellar properties -- such as
temperature, metallicity, and chemical abundances -- in an iterative
fashion.
