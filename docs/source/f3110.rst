Package f311
============

The root package provides the collaboration model implementation.

The collaboration model allows ``f311.COLLABORATORS`` to contribute with

- ``DataFile`` subclasses, i.e., implement handling (load, save, etc.) of new file types;
- ``Vis`` subclasses, i.e., implement visualizations for these files;
- Standalone scripts placed in the directory ``packagename/scripts``
