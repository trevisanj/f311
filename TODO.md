# f311 TODO list

## Top priority

- test well these GUIs

### Documentation

- Explain what F311 is

- scripts screenshots (aosss and pyfant as well)

- update explorer list_file_types() example

## Low priority

- new script to print filetypes as table

- programs.py: verbose collection of programs; show paths

- Enhance explorer.py with options for spectra: save as... (have to figure out practical save as)

# Future suggestions

- implement categories in scripts (perhaps a `# cat: whatever` in the source code)

- Enhance programs.py to sort alphabetically, generate single table (with word wrap). BTW it does not list itself
  Who cares which package. But I can filter in or out packages
